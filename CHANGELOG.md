    "statusCode": 200
  }
}
```

way 2:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "routeToMatch": "/(.*)",

      entry: object,
      routePath: string,
      routeConfig: RouteConfig,
      pathToRegexp: pathToRegexp
    ) => Routes,

# v2.3.1

- `transformHar` bug fix

# v2.3.0

- Bug Fix
- added CLI Usage with options.
- `excludeRoutes(routes, routesToExclude)` - returns routes with unExcluded routes.
- `transformHar` now has `excludedRoutes` in a config.
  This helps to excluded routes while generating mock from HAR.

```ts
  type transformHar = (
    harData?: HAR | string,
    config?: TransformHARConfig,
    ...
  ) => Routes;

  export type TransformHARConfig = {
    routesToLoop?: string[];
    routesToGroup?: string[];
    routeRewrite?: KeyValString;
    excludeRoutes?: string[];
  }

```

# v2.2.2

- Readme update

# v2.2.0

  - `methods` in routeConfig. Now we can set a route to a specific methods.
  - `mockServer.getRewrittenRoutes(routes, routeRewrite)` - returns routes with rewritten route path.
  - `mockServer.getRouteMatchList(routeToMatch, routes)` - returns list of matched routes to the given pattern
  - `transformHar` method with additional options. `pathToRegexp` - gives the methods available in `path-to-regexp` npm package
  ```ts
  type transformHar = (
    harData?: HAR | string,
    config?: {
      routesToLoop?: string[];
      routesToGroup?: string[];
      routeRewrite?: KeyValString;
    },
    entryCallback?: (
      entry: object,
      routePath: string,
      routeConfig: RouteConfig,
      pathToRegexp: pathToRegexp
    ) => Routes,
    finalCallback?: (
      generatedMock: Routes,

  - transformHar method now accepts config of `{ routesToLoop?: string[], routesToGroup?: string[] } ` as a second param. It helps to set loop and group mock as per the routes provided.
